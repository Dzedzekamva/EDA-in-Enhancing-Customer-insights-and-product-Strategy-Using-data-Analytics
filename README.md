EDA is essential for uncovering insights from data through visualization and statistical analysis. This task involves understanding distributions, identifying patterns, and detecting outliers, providing a comprehensive view of customer behaviors and product performance.

Steps Followed:
1. Analyze the distribution of key variables such as product prices and types of products purchased.

2. Identify patterns in purchase behaviors across different customer segments.

3. Utilize visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to explore data distributions and relationships.

4. Detect outliers and anomalies that may impact analysis and subsequent modeling.
